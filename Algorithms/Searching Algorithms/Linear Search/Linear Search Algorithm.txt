For Linear Search we will take an array K
Suppose we wish to search for element a
We will use looping structure to get our output.

Thus,

LinearSearch(K,a)

Step 1: Set i to 1
Step 2: if i > n
	  move to STEP 7
Step 3: if K[i] = a  
	  go to STEP 6
Step 4: Increment i/i++
Step 5: Repeat from STEP 2
Step 6: Print a is found at index i 
        move to STEP 8
Step 7: ELSE
	  Print element is not found
Step 8: Exit
